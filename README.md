# hubot-sysadmin

hubot-sysadmin is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot]. It is designed to run
on Raspberry Pis, especially those with [pihole][pihole] configured.  In this way,
you can do various sysadmin tasks via simply chatting with a configured Slack
channel and your hubot user!  

**ChatOps > SSH** (for simple stuff).

## Setup

TODO - make this reader friendly.

Install Slack, set up a workspace, get a Bot user, Get a legacy Api Token.

Install hubot-sysadmin on your raspberry pi.

Add the service to systemd

### Adding your own scripts

Basically following along with `/scripts/example.coffee`, you can make your own
little tasks.

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing. Check out the [docs][scripting-docs] and already made [scripts][scripts].

## Setting up with Slack

Hubot sysadmin uses the slack adapter, so will require a slack API key.  This is currently
only supported under the [legacy API token][legacy], which will allegedly die soon.  Git em while they're
hot!
